## üåü Overview

This project presents an Arduino-based digital spirometer designed for measuring key lung function parameters. It aims to provide an accessible and cost-effective tool for preliminary respiratory assessment. The system captures and analyzes expiratory airflow to determine vital pulmonary metrics.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Flow Rate Measurement**: Captures instantaneous airflow during exhalation.
-   **Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)**: Measures the total volume of air exhaled forcefully.
-   **Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)**: Measures the volume of air exhaled in the first second of forced expiration.
-   **FEV1/FVC Ratio Calculation**: Provides a critical clinical indicator for assessing respiratory health and identifying potential obstructive or restrictive patterns.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes a 16x2 LCD for displaying results and test status.
-   **Auditory and Visual Feedback**: Incorporates LEDs and a buzzer for test guidance and completion signals.
-   **Serial Data Output**: Allows for detailed data logging and analysis via the serial monitor.
-   **Portable and Low-Cost**: Built with readily available and affordable components.

## üìä Clinical Significance

The FEV1/FVC ratio helps in diagnosing:

| Condition | Typical FEV1/FVC Ratio |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Normal | > 70-80% |
| Obstructive (e.g., COPD, asthma) | < 70% |
| Restrictive (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) | Normal or increased (`‚â• 70-80%`, but with reduced FVC and FEV1) |

*Note: These are general guidelines. Clinical diagnosis should always be made by a qualified healthcare professional.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Required

-   Arduino Uno/Nano (or compatible microcontroller)
-   Flow sensor (e.g., YF-S201 or similar, with pulse output)
-   16x2 LCD Display (with I2C module recommended for simpler wiring)
-   LEDs:
    -   1 x Green LED (for indicating test readiness/completion)
    -   1 x Red LED (for indicating test in progress/error)
-   Buzzer (5V)
-   Pushbutton (momentary)
-   Resistors (e.g., 220Œ© for LEDs, 10kŒ© for pushbutton pulldown if needed)
-   Breadboard and jumper wires
-   Disposable mouthpiece (ensure hygienic use)
-   Power supply for Arduino (USB or external)

## üîå Hardware Setup

1.  **Flow Sensor**: Connect VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and the signal pin to a digital interrupt pin on the Arduino (e.g., D2 or D3).
2.  **LCD Display**:
    *   If using I2C LCD: Connect VCC to 5V, GND to GND, SDA to A4, SCL to A5.
    *   If using parallel LCD: Connect according to standard LCD wiring (RS, E, D4-D7, V0, etc.).
3.  **LEDs**: Connect the anode (longer leg) of each LED to a digital pin via a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220Œ©), and the cathode (shorter leg) to GND.
4.  **Buzzer**: Connect one pin to a digital pin and the other to GND.
5.  **Pushbutton**: Connect one terminal to a digital pin and the other to GND. Enable the internal pull-up resistor for the pin in software, or use an external pull-down resistor (10kŒ© to GND) with the other terminal connected to 5V.

*(A Fritzing diagram or a clear photo of the circuit would be highly beneficial here. Consider creating one and adding it.)*

## üíª Software Setup

1.  **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2.  **Libraries**:
    *   `LiquidCrystal_I2C` (if using an I2C LCD): Install via the Arduino Library Manager. Search for "LiquidCrystal I2C" by Frank de Brabander.
    *   `Wire.h` (for I2C communication, usually included with Arduino IDE).
3.  **Clone the Repository (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MostafaMousaaa/Intelligent-Respiratory-Monitoring-Spirometery.git
    cd Intelligent-Respiratory-Monitoring-Spirometery
    ```
4.  **Upload Sketch**: Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, select your board and port, and upload the sketch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The spirometer operates based on the principle of measuring airflow during a forced exhalation:

1.  **Initialization**: Upon startup, the system initializes the LCD, sensors, and awaits user input.
2.  **Test Initiation**: The user presses a pushbutton to start the spirometry test.
3.  **Exhalation Detection**: The system monitors the flow sensor. Once airflow is detected (start of exhalation), the measurement process begins.
4.  **Flow Rate Measurement**: The flow sensor generates electrical pulses proportional to the rate of airflow. The Arduino counts these pulses over short intervals (e.g., 250ms) to calculate the instantaneous flow rate (Liters/minute or Liters/second).
5.  **Volume Calculation**: The calculated flow rate is integrated over time to determine the cumulative volume of air exhaled (in milliliters or Liters).
    `Volume = Flow Rate √ó Time Interval`
6.  **FEV1 Recording**: The system precisely records the total volume exhaled at the 1-second mark from the start of exhalation. This is the FEV1.
7.  **Test Duration**: The test continues for a predefined duration (typically 6 seconds, as per ATS guidelines for FVC).
8.  **FVC Recording**: At the end of the 6-second exhalation period, the total accumulated volume is recorded as the FVC.
9.  **Ratio Calculation**: The FEV1/FVC ratio is calculated: `Ratio = (FEV1 / FVC) * 100%`.
10. **Results Display**: Key parameters (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio) are displayed on the LCD and sent to the serial monitor.
11. **Feedback**: Visual (LEDs) and auditory (buzzer) cues guide the user through the test (e.g., start, ongoing, end).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the Arduino Spirometer:

1.  **Assemble Hardware**: Connect all components as described in the [Hardware Setup](#-hardware-setup) section. Ensure all connections are secure.
2.  **Power Up**: Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB or to an appropriate power supply.
3.  **Upload Code**:
    *   Open the project sketch (`.ino` file) in the Arduino IDE.
    *   Select the correct board (e.g., "Arduino Uno", "Arduino Nano") from `Tools > Board`.
    *   Select the correct COM port from `Tools > Port`.
    *   Click the "Upload" button.
4.  **Open Serial Monitor**: Once uploaded, open the Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor` or `Ctrl+Shift+M`). Set the baud rate to 9600.
5.  **Prepare for Test**:
    *   Attach a clean, disposable mouthpiece to the flow sensor inlet.
    *   Ensure the user is in a comfortable, upright position (sitting or standing).
6.  **Initiate Test**:
    *   The LCD will display a "Ready" message.
    *   Press the pushbutton to start the test.
7.  **Perform Maneuver**:
    *   Take a deep breath in.
    *   Seal lips tightly around the mouthpiece.
    *   Exhale as forcefully and completely as possible for at least 6 seconds. The device will provide feedback.
8.  **View Results**: After the test duration (e.g., 6 seconds), the results (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio) will be displayed on the LCD and printed to the Serial Monitor.
9.  **Repeat (Optional)**: Press the button again to perform another test. It's common practice to perform at least three acceptable maneuvers.

## üìú Code Highlights

Key sections of the Arduino code include:

```c
// --- Pin Definitions & Global Variables ---
// ... (e.g., pins for LCD, LEDs, button, flow sensor)
// volatile unsigned long pulseCount = 0;
// float calibrationFactor = 4.5; // Example: Adjust based on your sensor

// --- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for Flow Sensor ---
void countPulse() {
  pulseCount++;
}

// --- Flow Rate Calculation (typically in loop or timed function) ---
unsigned long currentTime = millis();
if (currentTime - lastReadTime >= 250) { // Read every 250ms
  detachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(FLOW_SENSOR_PIN));
  flowRate = (pulseCount / calibrationFactor) * (1000.0 / (currentTime - lastReadTime)); // L/min or L/s
  totalMilliLitres += (flowRate / 60.0) * (currentTime - lastReadTime); // Convert L/min to mL/ms
  pulseCount = 0;
  lastReadTime = currentTime;
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(FLOW_SENSOR_PIN), countPulse, RISING);
}

// --- FEV1 Recording at exactly 1 second ---
if (testingInProgress && !fev1_recorded && (millis() - testStartTime >= 1000)) {
  fev1_volume = totalMilliLitres;
  fev1_recorded = true;
}

// --- FEV1/FVC Ratio Calculation ---
float ratio = 0;
if (fvc_volume > 0) {
  ratio = (fev1_volume / fvc_volume) * 100.0;
}
```

## üìù Important Considerations

-   **Hygiene**: Always use a new, clean, or sterilized mouthpiece for each user to prevent cross-contamination. Dispose of used mouthpieces appropriately.
-   **Calibration**: The `calibrationFactor` in the code is crucial for accuracy. This factor depends on your specific flow sensor and may need adjustment. Calibrate against a known volume or a commercial spirometer if possible.
-   **Posture and Technique**: For reliable results, the user should maintain proper posture (e.g., sitting upright) and ensure a tight seal with their lips around the mouthpiece. A forceful and complete exhalation is necessary.
-   **Environmental Factors**: Temperature and humidity can affect air density and flow sensor readings. Consider these if high precision is required.
-   **Not a Medical Device**: This project is for educational and prototyping purposes. It is **not a certified medical device** and should not be used for self-diagnosis or to replace professional medical advice or equipment.
